The app Crypto Wallet was created with a simple idea -- to let people buy and sell cryptocurrencies easily and without having to pay any type of cost to any third party. This app was designed with the idea of making Cryptocurrency a more widely known and a household name using Dart as the main programming language Flutter as the supporting framework and Kotlin as the backend language. The users of this app can view the current state of the crypto market from anywhere with an internet that too only needs a minuscule amount of data to keep the app running. The users can invest in any type of cryptocurrency as long as they have the minimum balance required in their bank accounts.
